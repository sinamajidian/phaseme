PhaseME
======

PhaseME is a tool set to assess the quality of the per read phasing information and help to reduce the errors during this process. 


# Quickstart

1- You require your VCF file to be read based phased, which can be generated by e.g. WhatsHap.

2- Run PhaseME to obtain stats and improve the quality of phase blocks.

```
python phaseme.py improver my.vcf precomputed
```
If you only want to have QC report use `qc` instead of `improver`. By not mentioning the last argument, PhaseME generates the individual-specific linkage information rather using precomputed one.



# Installation Test

Please try our sample data to establish the correctness of the pipeline installation. This can be found in the folder `example`.
