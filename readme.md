PhaseME
======

PhaseME is a tool set to assess the quality of the per read phasing information and help to reduce the errors during this process.


# Quickstart

1- You require your VCF file to be read based phased, which can be generated by e.g. WhatsHap.

2- Run PhaseME using Python3 on Linux to obtain stats and improve the quality of phase blocks. The only requirement is Numpy.

```
tar -xzf precomputed/pairlist.tar.gz
python phaseme.py improver my.vcf output_prefix
```
If you only want to have the quality assessment report use `quality` instead of `improver`.


## Installation Test

Please try our sample data to establish the correctness of the pipeline installation. This can be found in the folder `example`.

```
python phaseme.py improver example/my.vcf example/out
```

The output will be a quality assessment report `example/out/quality.csv` as well as an improved version of the input phased VCF `example/out/improved.vcf`.

# Complete usage

In quick start section the precomputed linkage information is used. Here, individual-specific linkage information is considered.  For grasping the full advantage of PhaseME, few steps are needed prior using PhaseME.

1- You need to download 1000 Genomes reference panel haplotypes.

```
wget https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/1000GP_Phase3.tgz
```
Warning: These are more than 10Gb.


2- You need to download the [Shapeit](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/shapeit/shapeit.html)

3- Now, run PhasME as following.


```
python phaseme.py improver my.vcf output_prefix  /path/to/shapeit /path/to/1000G/dataset
```


## Parental mode

PhaseME can also assess and improve the phasings results using parental data instead of linkage information. The user should prepare a three-sample VCF including son, mother and father SNV in this order. This can be done using e.g. `bcftools merge`. Prior to that you may need `bgzip`, `tabix` and `bcftools index` on all three samples. 

To obtain quality insights:
```
python phaseme.py quality example/trio.vcf example/out_trio_q trio
```

Once you want to improve phasing results:
```
python phaseme.py improver example/trio.vcf example/out_trio trio
```
