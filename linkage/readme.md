Generating individual-specific pair list
======




# Steps

1. You require your VCF file to be read based phased, which can be generated by e.g. Whatshap. 
2. You need 1000 Genomes reference panel haplotypes, which can be obtained from [here](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/1000GP_Phase3.html)

```
wget https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/1000GP_Phase3.tgz

wget https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/1000GP_Phase3_chrX.tgz
```

Warning: These are more than 10Gb.


3. Obtain population information over Shapeit


```
python population.py input_vcf /path/to/1000G
```


Note that Shapeit will complain about not-genotyped variations and those variants that are not bi-allelic. Thus we recommend to remove these from the VCF file.
